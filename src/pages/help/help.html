      <h2><b>Tariff</b></h2>
      <p>The cost at which you are charged per kilowatt used. Check with your electrcity provider to find out the cost, which can be usually
      found on their official website</p>
      <p>The cost may vary if the total spent kWh exceeds a specified threshold.....</p>
      <br>
      <h2><b>Flat Fee</b></h2>
      <p>A constant monthly amount charged to the user.</p>
      <p>You can check your fee from your bill or the electricals company website</p>
      <br>
      <h2><b>Tax Rate</b></h2>
      <p>If you live in a country where your electricity bill is tax inclusive, then make sure
      to include the tax % in your settings.</p>

      <h2><b>Calculations</b></h2>
      <p>The required details can be found on a power tag attached to the appliance, usually on the bottom or back.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In the case of appliances which only mention the voltage (V) and current (ampere) then the
      wattage is equal to the voltage * current</p>
      <p>For example the wattage of an appliance with a voltage of 220 and 4 ampere is 220 x 4 = 880 Watts</p>
      <!-- <p>However the given wattage isn't always accurate for certain appliances, please check the 'Compressor Cycles'
      section below for further details in regards to this matter</p> -->
      <br>
      <p>In the case of an air conditioner, each ton is equal to 3517 watts, divide that with its
      <i>energy effiecient ratio (EER)</i> to get its wattage consumption</p>
      <p>For example a 1 ton AC with energy star rating of 5 (3.5 EER) is 3517/3.5 = 1004.8.</p>
      <!-- <p>Take note that the calculations above do not take into account compressor cycles.</p> --> <br>
      <!-- <p>However some appliances do not always run on full load. This is covered in the <i>Compressor Cycles</i> section below</p> -->
      <br>

      <h2><b>Compressor Cycles</b></h2>
      <p>Some appliances aren't always operating at their listed maximum power consumption. A refrigerator for example would
        consume 55 watts while operating and typically runs for an average of 9 hours per day.</p>
      <br>
      <!-- <p>The compressor cycles option while adding an appliance can be enabled to take those calculations into account.
      Compressor cycle durations can be effected by multiple factors, which can cause the displayed result to be slightly inaccurate.</p> -->
      <p>There are several factors which can affect the total active hours and the wattage consumption,
        which can cause the displayed result to be slightly inaccurate.</p> <br>
      <h2><b>Air Conditoner Options</b></h2>
      <p>While adding an appliance, there are two options for air conditioners in the compressor cycles drop down list.</p>
      <p><b>Normal Cycles:</b> Select if the air conditoner usually runs for around 60-70% of the time</p>
      <br>
      <p><b>Long Cycles:</b> Select if the air conditoner run for longer durations than what is mentioned above.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In the case in which the air conditioner is always running, do not enable compressor cycles.</p>
      <br>
      <h2><b>Old Appliances</b></h2>
      <p>Modern appliances are much more efficient at saving electricity in comparison to older ones.</p>
      <p>For example a modern refrigerator consumes around 500 kWh on an annual basis, whereas a Refrigerator
        manufactured before 2001 can spend well over 800 kWh</p>
