      <h2><b>Tariff</b></h2>
      <p>The cost at which you are charged per kilowatt-hour(kWh) used,
      check with your electrcity provider to find out the cost, which can be usually
      found on their official website</p>
      <br>

      <h2><b>Flat Fee</b></h2>
      <p>A constant monthly amount charged to the user.</p>
      <p>You can check your fee from your bill or the electrical's company website</p>
      <br>

      <h2><b>Tax Rate</b></h2>
      <p>If you live in a country where your electricity bill is tax inclusive, then make sure
      to include the tax % on the app settings.</p>

    <ion-item-divider color="secondary">Power Consumption</ion-item-divider>
    <ion-item text-wrap no-lines color="background" text-justified>
      <h2><b>Calculations</b></h2>
      <p>Power is measured in watts and is the rate at which energy is produced or consumed,
        a bulb which is rated at 40 watts will consume a constant 40 watts.
        To find out how much power your appliance consumes, the required information can be found on a
        power tag attached to it, usually on the bottom or back.</p>
      <br>

      <p>In the case of appliances which only mention the voltage (V) and current (ampere) then the
      wattage is equal to the voltage * current</p>
      <p>For example the wattage of an appliance with a voltage of 220 and 4 ampere is 220 x 4 = 880 Watts</p>
      <br>

      <p>In the case of an air conditioner, each ton is equal to 3517 watts, divide that with its
      <i>energy effiecient ratio (EER)</i> to get its wattage consumption</p>
      <p>For example a 1 ton AC with energy star rating of 5 (3.5 EER) is 3517/3.5 = 1004.8.</p>
      <br>

      <h2><b>Variable Power Consumption</b></h2>
      <p>Some appliances aren't always operating at their listed variable power consumption. A refrigerator for example would
        consume 55 watts while operating and typically runs for an average of 9 hours per day.</p>
      <br>

      <p>There are several factors which can affect the total active hours and the wattage consumption,
        which can cause the displayed result to be slightly inaccurate.</p>
      <br>

      <h2><b>Air Conditoner Options</b></h2>
      <p>While adding an appliance, upon emabling the <i>variable power consumption</i> check box,
        there are two options for air conditioners in the appliance type drop down list.</p>
      <p><b>Normal Cycles:</b> Select if the air conditoner usually runs for around 60-70% of the time</p>
      <br>

      <p><b>Long Cycles:</b> Select if the air conditoner run for longer durations than what is mentioned above.</p>
      <br>

      <p>In the case in which the air conditioner is always running, do not enable the <i>variable power consumption</i> checkbox.</p>
      <br>

      <h2><b>Old Appliances</b></h2>
      <p>Modern appliances are much more efficient at saving electricity in comparison to older ones.</p>
      <p>For example a modern refrigerator consumes around 500 kWh on an annual basis, whereas a refrigerator
        manufactured before 2001 can spend well over 800 kWh</p>
